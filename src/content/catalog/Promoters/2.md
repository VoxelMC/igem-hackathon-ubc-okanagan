Sometimes, we ignore the details of how a promoter works and think of a promoter as a device that converts inputs into outputs. You can do this when designing a multi-component system that includes promoters whose activity must be regulated by other species in the system. A promoter can be thought of as a device that outputs a certain number of transcribing RNA polymerases per unit time. Promoters can have different numbers of inputs. A constitutive promoter has no inputs. Technically, even a constitutive promoter has inputs, such as the level of free RNA polymerase, but we often assume that levels of free RNA polymerase are either unchanging, or never be the limiting factor in transcription initiation. The level of a repressor that negatively regulates a promoter is an input to a promoter.
